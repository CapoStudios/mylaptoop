## Description

MyLaptoop advises users which and where to buy various computer parts.

The app was created using the [Flutter Framework](https://flutter.dev/), so is avaible on [Android](https://github.com/CapoStudios/mylaptoop/releases/download/v1.0.77/app-release.apk) and the [Web](https://capostudios.github.io/mylaptoop/). 
There is also a version for [IOS](https://github.com/CapoStudios/mylaptoop/releases/download/v1.0.77/app.ipa) (".ipa" file), but I don't have any Apple device so I can't test it. 
I would really appreciate if anyone can try (let me know if it works).

This project is completely Open Source and under MIT Licence, so feel free to view and copy the project code if you want.

That's all for now.

Thanks for Collaboration!

And as always Happy Coding! üë®‚Äçüíªüí™
