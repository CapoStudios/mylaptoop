A new App created by CapoStudios with the [Flutter Framework](https://flutter.dev/).

## Description

This App advises users which and where to buy various pieces of Computers.
The App is Avaible on [Android](https://github.com/CapoStudios/mylaptoop/releases/download/v1.0.77/app-release.apk) and the [Web](https://capostudios.github.io/mylaptoop/). 
There is also a version for [IOS](https://github.com/CapoStudios/mylaptoop/releases/download/v1.0.77/app.ipa) (".ipa" file), but I don't have any Apple device so I can't test it. I would really appreciate if anyone can try.
This Project is Open Source and Under MIT Licence, so feel free to view and copy the project code if you want.

That's All For Now.

Thanks for Collaboration!
And As always Happy Coding! üë®‚Äçüíªüí™
